It's been a while since I've posted anything here, as it's been a busy and productive few months. With any luck I'll have a few things in print soon, but in the meantime, here's a [link](http://rr.proquest.com/2014/05/take-five/) to a small post I did for the new [Revise & Resubmit](http://rr.proquest.com/) blog and discussion forum.

I've never really given much thought to pinning down a list of intellectual influences, so this was kind of a strange exercise. Ultimately the five texts I chose are not necessarily the _best_ books or sources, but they are ones that I think worked to nudge my thinking in a different direction at particular moments in my life.
