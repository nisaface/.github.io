**There seems to be a lot of interest in this particular post out in California--I'd love to hear more...**

I just read Teju Cole’s [characteristically beautiful](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/24/magazine/death-in-the-browser-tab.html?_r=2) meditation on the nature of mediation and death. In discussing Eddie Adams’ iconic photograph of Nguyen Ngoc Loan fatally shooting Nguyen Van Lem, Cole writes:

> “But when you see death mediated in this way, pinned down with such dramatic flair, the star is likely to be death itself and not the human who dies.”

Importantly too, the structuring power of the moment of death itself also mediates another key human element, in the case of Eddie Adams’ famous photograph, the human who *kills*. But even when the star is death itself, neither the killer nor the killed is completely erased.

In reading that passage I was reminded of Susan Sontag’s book *Regarding the Pain of Others*, in which she tackles the “breathtaking provincialism” of those caught in a Baudrillardian knot, where all—including lethal violence—is spectacle and simulation. She writes that there is a distinct geographic remapping that plays out in the interpretation of images in this way, as it:

> “assumes everyone is a spectator. It suggests that there is no real suffering in the world. But it is absurd to identify the world with those zones in the well-off countries where people have the dubious privilege of becoming spectators, or of declining to be spectators, of other people’s pain.”

<cite>Sontag, *Regarding the Pain of Others*, page 117.

Cole’s piece encourages us to complicate our understanding of this ‘dubious privilege,’ describing the third time he watches the video of Walter Scott being shot in the back by Michael Slager:

> “Finally, I start to watch footage of Scott’s last moments. It’s the third time, and it makes me uneasy and unhappy. The video begins with the man holding the camera racing toward the fence. A few seconds later, Walter Scott breaks away from Michael Slager. Slager plants his feet and raises his gun. There is still time. He shoots once, then thrice in quick succession. Scott continues to run. There is still time. That is when I stop the video and exit the browser.”

This ability to exit is of course in many ways a luxury. But in his exploration, the relationship between Cole, these images of death, and the lived lives of those who die moves. The interface is at times located between the viewer and the viewed, at others between researcher and spatial/historical context, and at still other times it mediates between a distant and coherent observer subject and life as a potential target of spectacular and/or structural violence.
