      <p>I’m working on putting together two talks for next week, and in reading something I wrote a long time ago, I came across this really great quote from Robert Penn Warren’s <em>All the King’s Men</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The end of man is knowledge, but there’s one thing he can’t know. He can’t know whether knowledge will save him or kill him. He will be killed, all right, but he can’t know whether he is killed because of the knowledge which he has got or because of the knowledge which he hasn’t got and which if he had it would save him. There’s the cold in your stomach, but you open the envelope, you have to open the envelope, for the end of man is to know.</p>

      <p>It’s been a while since I’ve posted anything here, as it’s been a busy and productive few months. With any luck I’ll have a few things in print soon, but in the meantime, here’s a <a href="http://rr.proquest.com/2014/05/take-five/">link</a> to a small post I did for the new <a href="http://rr.proquest.com/">Revise &amp; Resubmit</a> blog and discussion forum.</p>

<p>I’ve never really given much thought to pinning down a list of intellectual influences, so this was kind of a strange exercise. Ultimately the five texts I chose are not necessarily the <em>best</em> books or sources, but they are ones that I think worked to nudge my thinking in a different direction at particular moments in my life.</p>

<h3 id="calculative-devices-in-a-digital-age-conference-durham-university-november-2013">CALCULATIVE DEVICES IN A DIGITAL AGE CONFERENCE, DURHAM UNIVERSITY, NOVEMBER 2013</h3>

<p>In the past decade, a new form of bodily capture premised on the acquisition and distribution of digital biometric information has begun to redefine the spatial limits of military detention. As biometric enrollment has become a more common military tool, and the information it procures distributed to civilian and military databases alike, identity is increasingly linked to a series of relational effects—group affiliations, family histories, travel itineraries, banking records—of which the physical body is just one manifestation. On the battlefield, biometrics are thus aimed at enabling an automated interpretation of the relationship between bodies and a field of information in order to facilitate a specific decision: to validate or invalidate movement or employment; to establish the parameters for military detainment; to track; or to allow safe passage. Flitting between data capture and bodily capture at the speed of bandwidth, this kind of apprehension remaps the landscape of detainee capture into a performance inseparable from technologies that seek to anticipate and spatially isolate emerging threats.</p>

<p>In this paper, I map the encounters that generate these thresholds between inside and outside, highlighting the geographically distributed actors operating via multiple technological interfaces: warfighters with enrollment devices in the field; analysts, algorithms, and computer processors at desks in West Virginia. I also detail the sites of encounter where biometric information is generated. While digital databases are supposedly indifferent to the information they contain, sites of data production are politically varied and geographically discrete. For some, the interface is literally thrust upon them.</p>

      <p>Spring 2014</p>

<p>This course serves as an introduction to the core principles, theories, and histories of economics, with specific attention to the issues that shape the spatial contours of the global economy. We will work to develop a basic understanding of contemporary public debates about economic policy and explore the relationships between spaces, labor, and markets. By the end of the semester, we will have engaged with concepts like globalization, austerity, and neoliberalism and studied the often-conflicting roles of economic actors like states, producers, and consumers.</p>

<p>This is not technically a microeconomics course, nor is it a macroeconomics course. Instead, this class seeks to foster critical economic thinking and prepare students to engage with broad economic debates in order to understand the role that markets and exchange play in structuring our world.</p>

      <p>This <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/magazine/laura-poitras-snowden.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/magazine/laura-poitras-snowden.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">article</a> on Laura Poitras and Glenn Greenwald from today's <em>New York Times</em> is bonkers. You really get a window into how crazy it must be to live with a heightened 'risk profile':</p>
<p><img class="quote" src="http://www.crisisofenclosure.com/images/quote.png" />&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p><blockquote>Though she has written to members of Congress and has submitted Freedom of Information Act requests, Poitras has never received any explanation for why she was put on a watch list. “It’s infuriating that I have to speculate why,” she said. “When did that universe begin, that people are put on a list and are never told and are stopped for six years? I have no idea why they did it. It’s the complete suspension of due process.” She added: “I’ve been told nothing, I’ve been asked nothing, and I’ve done nothing. It’s like Kafka. Nobody ever tells you what the accusation is.”</blockquote></p>
<p>These national security practices are autonomous <em>and</em> out of control: a dubious combination. The article also contains a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/video/2012/08/22/opinion/100000001733041/the-program.html" title="http://www.nytimes.com/video/2012/08/22/opinion/100000001733041/the-program.html">link</a> to a short 'OpDoc' that Poitras made for the <em>Times</em> in August of 2012.The video focuses on NSA whistleblower William Binney, and is definitely worth ten minutes of your time:<br /><br />
<iframe width="480" height="373" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" id="nyt_video_player" title="New York Times Video - Embed Player" src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/bcvideo/1.0/iframe/embed.html?videoId=100000001733041&amp;playerType=embed"></iframe>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting comment in the film, at least for me, was the clear articulation of the NSA's understanding of the word 'intercept'. On a panel at the DefCon Convention in Las Vegas, Alexander Abdo, the Staff Attorney for the ACLU National Security Project notes (at around the 4 minute mark) that:</p>
<img class="quote" src="http://www.crisisofenclosure.com/images/quote.png" /></p>
<p><blockquote>Acquisition isn't the search, the querying later on is the search."</blockquote></p>
<p>It's a bit striking to think that the wholesale vacuuming up of any and all information is thought of as completely innocuous, implying that the politics is merely in the application of the search algorithms that define the limits of things like 'threat' or 'enemy'. Since the politics only emerge the moment that these 'refined' searches are sent through the database, everyone else has nothing to worry about. See?! That was easy!</p>
<p>Can it possibly be true that the the national security state actually sees data as being free of politics? No way. Do they care. Nope. Should we? I think so.
