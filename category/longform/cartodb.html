<h1>Mapping Adjunct Pay<br></h1><h2>at Colleges and Universities across the U.S.</h2>
<br><p>This is my first pass at a map exploring the relationships between adjunct instructor pay (taken from the most recent data submitted to the Chronicle of Higher Educationâ€™s <i>The Adjunct Project</i>) and state minimum wage data:</p>

<p>Finally, zooming in further reveals a different set of relationships between adjunct pay and the number of courses that they would have to teach in order to make the equivalent of one year's full time work at a minimum wage job. While some schools are beginning to pay their adjuncts better, the median number of courses needed to make minimum wage is 6.8 per year, or the equivalent of a full-time teaching load at many liberal arts colleges. At one school, an adjunct would need to teach as many as 50 courses per year to meet their state's minimum wage:</p>
