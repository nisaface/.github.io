[Society & Space](https://www.societyandspace.org/) recently published [my review](https://www.societyandspace.org/articles/the-interrogation-rooms-of-the-korean-war-by-monica-kim) for Monica Kim’s excellent book *Interrogation Rooms of the Korean War: The Untold History* as part of a [book review forum](https://www.societyandspace.org/book-review-forums/transpacific-geographies) on the theme of “Transpacific Geographies.” For this forum, I, along with Dr. Wesley Attewell and Dr. Emily Mitchell-Eaton wrote reviews of three books and framed them with a substantive introductory essay. We also compiled a short microsyllabus for geographers teaching material that intersects with the oft-overlooked transpacific:

>"Why, given all of the ways that we still live with the legacies of violence near the 38th parallel, do political and historical geographers focus so exclusively on other mid-century case studies like Vietnam or the transatlantic Cold War, replicating the omissions embedded in films like *The Never-ending War?* As Kim’s text makes evident, the borders drawn on the peninsula may frame our conversations about its geographic history, but they often obscure more impactful infrastructural connections that continue to have dynamic and often devastating afterlives. In *The Interrogation Rooms of the Korean War*, Kim is making a world, *mapping* a world, out from a small room, and likewise mapping a small room through the tangled circuitry of the world."
