The next couple of months are shaping up to be really busy and (hopefully) really productive.

In a month's time I'll be headed to Chicago to give a paper on the logistics of military detention in precision war, specifically, Operation Desert Storm. I'm still trying to map out the talk, but I think I will try to explore two competing military logistical narratives--one feeding the violence of a surgical 'war without bodies' and the other, that of the camps, tasked with feeding and housing the very real bodies that occupy the spaces of violent conflict. I still have a long way to go prepping that one, but the [group of papers](http://meridian.aag.org/callforpapers/program/SessionDetail.cfm?SessionID=21734) that [make up](http://meridian.aag.org/callforpapers/program/SessionDetail.cfm?SessionID=21735) the [sessions](http://meridian.aag.org/callforpapers/program/SessionDetail.cfm?SessionID=21736) look pretty great. It will be interesting to see how far I can push the my research along before then, and how (and if) my work fits into the growing body of work on logistical spaces.

Then it's off to Cornell at the end of the semester for a week at the Summer Institute on Contested Global Landscapes through the [Institute for Social Sciences](http://socialsciences.cornell.edu/). I'm currently working on the paper that will be workshopped there, which will look more closely at the role of detention during the US military occupation of southern Korea, and how decisions about policing and detaining made between 1945 and 1948 would help shape the wartime practices of 1950-1953. More than anything else, I think I am excited to meet and work with the [other](http://socialsciences.cornell.edu/participants-in-the-2015-summer-institute/) early career scholars to improve my work and expand my understanding of the relationships between war, policing, and governance.

After that, I'll be headed to the International Conference of Historical Geographers in [London](ichg2015.org) to give a paper about Korea. Somewhere in all of this I also hope to get my book prospectus out into the world and visit the National Archives for some follow up work.
