I just completed my first ever mapping course, *Foundations: Spatial Thinking, Data, and Design*, through the [SAVI](https://www.pratt.edu/pratt-research-and-centers/spatial-analysis-visualization-initiative/) program at Pratt. The short class was really great, and the two instructors, [Alihan Polat](http://www.studiomplus.nyc/) and [Jeff Ferzoco](http://linepointpath.com/) were fantastic. While it feels strange to say that I managed to get a doctorate in geography without any mapping experience, I am feeling the bug to jump in now with both feet.

Running with one of [N's](http://nickyagate.com/) many great suggestions, for my [class project](http://crisisofenclosure.com/category/longform/cartodb.html) (the course was only 5 weeks long), I put together a map that I hoped might tell a story about the nature of adjunct pay in universities and colleges across the country. I've been thinking about adjunct labor in some way or another [for a while](http://crisisofenclosure.com/nickel-and-dimed/), so I was glad that I was able to get a hold of a pretty extensive dataset from the Chronicle of Higher Education's [*Adjunct Project*](http://adjunct.chronicle.com/) and link it up with state minimum wage data. While I had hoped to use some of [this](http://livingwage.mit.edu/) data, that was ultimately untenable.

So, while there are definite limitations to what I came up with (both technologically and methodologically), but I still think that this initial pass tells a compelling story about the nature of this increasingly exploited class of 'contingent labor' in higher education. I've got some ideas about how to improve this visualization and take the project further, but I thought I'd share my first pass here.
