I just received the poster for an upcoming workshop on critical logistics that I'm super excited to be participating in:

The lineup looks pretty amazing, and I look forward to learning a lot with and from them. It'll also be great to catch up with some old [friends](http://www.millionsofmovingparts.org) while I'm in Toronto.
 
There's nothing [there](https://turbulentcirculation.wordpress.com) yet, but this is the link for the workshop website.
