title: "Reading Nickel and Dimed when Talking about Adjunct Labor"
category: blog
---

Today in my [Economics and Society](/economics-and-society/) class we discussed Barbara Ehrenreich's classic *Harper's* essay "Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting by in America." The general class discussion of the text was preceded by an exploration of issues like income and wealth, class, labor, and labor power. We eventually transitioned to the reading, and a discussion about price floors and the minimum wage debate. Our conversation veered in a number of directions: students at times seeming hopeful that minimum wage increases would help alleviate poverty and at other times seeming to align themselves with the neoclassical economists' critique of such an idea.

Much of what we concentrated on had to do with perceptions of low wage work, the stigmatization of low wage workers in general, and the nature of their work. As Wednesday was National Adjunct Walkout Day, I ended class with a few images about the rise of adjunct labor in higher education and the particular forms that that labor played at our own school. While a bit facile (or so I thought), my point to them was that the line that separates adjunct labor from the work that Ehrenreich discusses in her essay is eroding rather rapidly, and right under the students' noses. A number of them were shocked and surprised that college teaching was so precarious, so exploited, and so invisible.

One thing I worried about in class was that if I spoke of adjuncts and line chefs in the same breath, I ran the risk of erasing (or minimizing) the harsh realities of low wage labor in places like those Ehrenreich writes about. But after coming back to my office, I saw that one of my Facebook friends had linked to [this article](http://www.psmag.com/business-economics/are-adjunct-professors-the-new-fast-food-workers) about adjuncts on *Pacific Standard's* site. In it, author Ana Beatriz Cholo does indeed make this connection for us:

> "'Fifty percent of the faculty in our country make what somebody at McDonaldâ€™s makes,' she said, adding that more and more adjuncts are going on public assistance and needing food stamps to survive."

Oof...
