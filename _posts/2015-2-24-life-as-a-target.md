<cite>Still from *This War of Mine*

My colleague [John](http://view2.fdu.edu/academics/becton-college/social-sciences-and-history/faculty/john-schiemann/) sent me a link to [this](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/gaming/2015/02/siege_survival_video_game_this_war_of_mine_reviewed.html) article about *This War of Mine,* a video game by Polish developer 11 Bit Studios. What is fascinating about the game is that instead of the player occupying the station point of a shooter, they perform the role of a civilian in a conflict zone. From the *Slate* article about the game:

> It is an often unforgiving game, one in which your survival always feels like it rests on the edge of a knife. No matter what choices you make, there never seems to be quite enough food, medicine, or time to rest. Who sleeps? Who eats? If everyone is sick or injured, who do you send out to root through the wreckage of the city for supplies, knowing they’ll surely return worse off—if they come back at all?

I'm really interested in the ways that space and culture are represented (the game is loosely based off of the siege of Sarajevo), but also in the work that the game does in a gaming community so deeply affected by first person shooter games. It's remarkable that this idea has not been pursued before (though I suppose my lack of gaming chops might mean that I am just unaware of others). It's a testament to the efficacy of the militarization of all things that the idea of flipping the script and enduring the complications of life (and not the destruction of life) in wartime seems so marginal. Is this a game that, because you don't kill, isn't seen as *fun*, but simply *hard*? I wonder what the ramifications of a game like this are. Are gamers more likely to humanize their targets when they play first person shooter games? Does playing this game make those games less fun?
