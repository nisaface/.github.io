From Gregory Henderson's account of the Korean conflict:

>"Chaos was probably aggravated by the man selected for command in Korea. Two qualify generals were considered but had to be dropped. Choice was made at the last minute by the sheerest expediency. Shipping was short. The occupation must come from a place as near Korea as possible. Time was shorter: the Russians begin entering Korea on August 12. The closest large unit was the 24th Court of Okinawa, six hundred miles away; it was accordingly jumped on as the appropriate unit for occupation, and it's commanding general, Hodge, went along with the package...**unintellectual and without the slightest pretensions of qualification for the political nature of his job, General Hodge was very possibly the first man in history selected to wield executive powers over a nation of nearly twenty million on the basis of shipping time.**"
