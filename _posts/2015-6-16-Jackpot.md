I just finished reading William Gibson’s [*The Peripheral,*](http://www.amazon.com/The-Peripheral-William-Gibson/dp/0399158448) and it was pretty fantastic. While not a scary book, I nonetheless found the narrative's connections to everyday life in 2015 deeply unsettling. One thing that struck me was how he described the "jackpot," or the series of disparate events that brought an end to one system of human social organization (80% of the people died) and initiated the subsequent regime:

> And first of all that it was no one thing. That it was multicausal, with no particular beginning and no end. More a climate than an event, so not the way apocalypse stories liked to have a big event, after which everybody ran around with guns, looking like Burton and his posse, or else were eaten alive by something caused by the big event. Not like that.

And this initial description, to me, is so hauntingly possible--nay probable--that it left me anxious and unable to escape thinking about the perils of the Anthropocene (or, [maybe it's](https://vimeo.com/97663518) the *Capitalocene?* The *Chthulucene?*). Perhaps the current fascination with apocalypse literature and [film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23VflsU3kZE) which, as they say, sells, throws our collective imaginaries off the scent of what is really happening. Like systemic violence when compared to spectacular violence, or structural hunger when compared to acute famine, the more immediate, random catastrophic events that get our attention and freak us out most can miss important points entirely. We are in it.

*Already.*

Gibson's description of the jackpot continues:

>"It was androgenic, he said, and she knew from *Ciencia Loca* and *National Geographic* that that meant because of people. Not that they’d known what they were doing, had meant to make problems, but they’d caused it anyway. And in fact the actual climate, the weather, caused by there being too much carbon, had been the driver for a lot of other things. How that got worse and never better, and was just expected to, ongoing. Because people in the past, clueless as to how that worked, had fucked it all up, then not been able to get it together to do anything about it, even after they knew, and now it was too late. So now, in her day, he said, they were headed into androgenic, systemic, multiplex, seriously bad shit, like she sort of already knew, figured everybody did, except for people who still said it wasn’t happening, and those people were mostly expecting the Second Coming anyway.”
<cite>Gibson, *The Peripheral*, page 319-320.

Earlier in the book was another passage that also rang true to this kind of reality--where we build systems (digital, in this case) and seemingly everyday infrastructures that we have no capacity to control. Nor do we have a full accounting of or recognition of what it is that they actually *do*:

> "How did you know,” Netherton asked, “that it would be on its way here?” <br>“The aunties,” said Lowbeer. <br>“Aunties?” <br>“We call them that. Algorithms. We have a great many, built up over decades. I doubt anyone today knows quite how they work, in any given instance."
<cite>Gibson, *The Peripheral*, page 145.

And somewhere in the thick optimism of technological systems, digital networks, and extractive market expansions, our jackpot has likely already commenced.
