      I just started reading this on the train yesterday. It's the second book in a row by a William, and the second in a row that is both entertaining and deeply unsettling. So far, it's like an economic sociologist's research monograph written in the style of a Seinfeld episode. That's not to say it's a book about nothing. Far from it. Rather, as I read it I find I'm laughing, or at least shaking my head at the absurdity of it all, but it generates a great deal of dis-ease and anxiety for me at the same time.<br><br>

      Gibson's dark narrative of an encounter between the worlds of two different time periods is as entertaining as it is unsettling. Reading it I moved between fascination with the worlds that Gibson created and a deep discomfort with how totally plausible many of the book's darker scenes were. It was the perfect book to start the summer with.<br><br><br><br><br>

      I’m still just cracking the surface, but I figured as well that I should start trying to put my thoughts on readings up on the site—to use this place as I had initially intended it to be used.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
