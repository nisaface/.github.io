N passed along this passage from a book she's reading, *The Water Knife,* which from the way she's described it, is clearly a book I'll be reading when she's done:

>"This was never about believing...This was about looking and seeing. Pure data. You don't believe data--you test data." He grimaced."If I could put my finger on the moment we genuinely fucked ourselves, it was the moment we decided that data was something you could use words like **believe** or **disbelieve** around."<br>
