As I continue to read through the archives of the *New York Times* for some more context about the US Military Government in Korea, I came across these two quite different dispatches regarding the installation of key liberal freedoms on the peninsula.  

First comes a [20 September 1945](http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1945/09/20/88296646.html?pageNumber=2) *New York Times* article proclaiming, with much fanfare, the introduction of, among other things, freedom of the press in southern Korea in the wake of Japanese colonial rule.

Beyond this short intro clipped here, the article continues by noting that the US was making progress in removing former colonial police from the state rolls, while also attempting to assure readers that the military government is 'not bankrupt.'

The first image sits in stark contrast to the second, [from a month later](http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1945/10/30/94029061.html?pageNumber=2), quietly walking back that bold pronouncement in the face of the distribution of pamphlets critical of the occupation. That little blurb is the whole article, and stands as the only writeup this significant retraction received.
