title: “Homo Diluvii Testis”

I’ve been reading Elizabeth Kolbert’s *The Sixth Extinction* and a short passage in the second chapter caught my eye. In a section where Kolbert is conveying the historical emergence of extinction, she describes a mistakenly identified fossil found in the Netherlands that had been given the name *Homo diluvii testis* (or ‘man who was witness to the flood’). Given what I've been reading lately--like William Gibson's *The Peripheral* and other--I couldn't help but think that this name--originally meant for an organism with a "large, half-moon-shaped skull"--could describe a global us, the mass of humans living through the anthropocene spectating and participating in a long, slow flood 
The name *homo diluvii testis* also recalls Giorgio Agamben's *homo sacer*. I started to wonder if perhaps we have become *homines diluvii testis*
