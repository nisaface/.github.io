title: The Sea is History

During her talk at workshop I recently participated in at the University of Toronto, the inimitable Laleh Khalili read the entirety of a poem by Derek Walcott titled *The Sea is History*. I don't encounter a lot of poetry in my life, and when I do I'm not often moved by it. But this particular poem really seemed to strike a chord with me, with its tales of seafarers careening across the watery surface, further submerging already buried memories, bodies, and systems of economic exploitation. Here's the first stanza:

> Where are your monuments, your battles, martyrs?<br>
Where is your tribal memory? Sirs,<br>
in that grey vault. The sea. The sea<br>
has locked them up. The sea is History.<br>
<cite>“The Sea is History” from *Selected Poems by Derek Walcott*. 2007</cite>
