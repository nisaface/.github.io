title: "Distributed Cognition and Automated Decisions"
---

On a recent interview, someone suggested that I might be interested in the work of [Jennifer Mnookin](http://www.law.ucla.edu/faculty/all-faculty-profiles/professors/Pages/jennifer-l-mnookin.aspx), who works at the UCLA School of Law. In digging around a bit I came across two things worth a brief mention. The first, is Mnookin’s [writing](http://lpr.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/1/47.abstract) on automated fingerprint technologies. This is indeed something that I will spend some time with, as I am working on an article about the shifting technologies of wartime detainee administration over the past sixty-odd years. I haven't read the whole article yet, but she provides a really useful breakdown of forms of human/technology 'distributed cognition'. I find the third particularly helpful in my own research:

> A third mode of distributed cognition involves an even greater and more meaningful role for technology and automation, while still preserving some limited province for the human. Here, the bulk of the ‘important’ work is done by the technological process, but the human expert still retains a degree of involvement and perhaps some limited control. In this mode, the expert operates in the shadow of the technology....The ‘work’ needed to produce a test result owes far more to the instrument’s operations than it does to the relatively ministerial tasks performed by the human operator.
> <cite>Mnookin, J. 2010. "The use of technology in human expert domains: challenges and risks arising from the use of automated fingerprint identification systems in forensic science," _Law, Probability and Risk,_ Vol. 9, No. 1: p.48,49.</cite>

This is certainly interesting and I look forward to thinking more about it in relation to digital biometrics in the military theater. Also interesting is the fact that there is a scholarly journal called [_Law, Probability & Risk_](http://lpr.oxfordjournals.org/). How did I miss this? While I can't spend much time with it today, I look forward to diving into the back issues while I read some Ian Hacking for a reading group.  Hopefully, the tandem will be useful.

On the off chance that the interviewer is reading this…thanks for the tip!
