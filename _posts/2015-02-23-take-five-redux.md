title: "Take Five, Again"
---

Back in May of last year, I posted a [link](http://rr.proquest.com/2014/05/take-five/) to a short entry I wrote detailing five texts, images, or objects that have molded my work and thinking  as a scholar. As I am not sure how much longer the site will be active, I've decided to repost the entry below the jump.

> *I've never really given much thought to pinning down a list of intellectual influences, so this was kind of a strange exercise. Ultimately the five texts I chose are not necessarily the _best_ books or sources, but they are ones that I think worked to nudge my thinking in a different direction at particular moments in my life.*


#### Lebbeus Woods:

It wasn’t until being asked to put together my Take Five that I even considered how Lebbeus Woods’ images have influenced my work or thinking. But the more I think about my thinking—which for me is a strange proposition—the more I realize his images have acted as a reference point to which I repeatedly return. My ‘career’ thus far has spanned two fairly distinct disciplines—architecture and geography—and at several steps along the way I have been compelled by Woods’ work to reconsider how ideas like enclosure, property, and boundary can (and should) be destabilized. I also think that on some level I’m drawn to the weird optimism that runs through his work. Wood’s renderings always seem to encourage me to consider better worlds, or at least different ones, whose conditions of possibility are masked and yet only made possible by the violence and institutions of the past.



#### Michel Foucault: *Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison*

I know I know…an obvious choice, but my research is about the spatial practices and technologies that make the war prison.I first read this book as a second year architecture student, and I don’t think I’d be being dishonest if I credit it with shifting my interests from designing spaces to exploring the interplay of space and power. I just reread a big hunk of this book in preparation for teaching a course on surveillance and security, and the thing that stood out to me was just how beautifully written and clear it is as a narrative. I’m not sure many of my students agree, but maybe—hopefully—one of them read it and it similarly nudged them in a new, productive direction.



#### Caroline Nordstrom: *Shadows of War: Violence, Power, and International Profiteering in the Twenty-First Century*

Nordstrom’s book—an ethnographic portrait of contemporary international war and wartime economics—stands out among the many accounts of combat I’ve read. Rather than underscoring the official or formal structures of conflict narratives, she presents war as something more akin to a fragmented and illusory shadow. Years after first reading the book, I often think about her comment that “the myth of an orderly war is more bearable” (33). Shadows of War demonstrates the importance of engaging with the blurred and messy divisions that are often simplified in the name of a bearable storyline: civilian and combatant; war and peace; friend and enemy; state and non-state; legal and non-legal; visible and invisible; inside and outside. But this doesn’t mean it has to be unclear, unsympathetic, or work to reproduce these borders. Clear writing about the unstable and the imprecise: that’s certainly a goal of mine as a writer and a thinker.



#### Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison: *Objectivity*

My work increasingly engages with an exploration of the uneven historical movement from analog to digitally automated decision-making. So I was lucky I came across Objectivity while reading about precision war and the so-called Revolution in Military Affairs. So many of those texts focused attention on the idea that the battlefield can be known objectively, that a tool like digital biometrics enrollment—storing scanned copies of fingerprints, iris detail, hand geometry, facial structure, etc.—can offer an objective, data-driven form of “seeing without inference, interpretation, or intelligence” (17). Daston and Galison’s book helped bridge my archival findings, which detail various logistical complications and messy encounters, and these stories of revolutionary precision. The book also had the added benefit of sending me down a line of enquiry that led me to Ian Hacking and Jonathan Crary, two authors whose books could easily be on another version of my Take Five.



#### Ruth Wilson Gilmore: *Golden Gulag: Prisons, Surplus, Crisis, and Opposition in Globalizing California*

In her book, Wilson writes an incredibly detailed story about how the prison construction boom in California (and elsewhere) in the 1980s was not connected to changes in crime rates or increased drug arrests in the state, but to the collapse of the prevailing political economic order. But I chose Golden Gulag not only because it is an amazing book—it is—but also because of the impact that Gilmore had on me when I first heard her speak.

At the time I was in the throes of archival work. Under that thick pile of documents, I had been feeling divorced from the important political and economic issues that underpin detainment’s increasingly central role in facilitating global order. But I remember leaving her talk feeling ready to engage critically and confidently with my little corner of the neoliberal punitive turn. If you ever get the chance to hear her speak—do it.

Plus, she’s a geographer (who earned her degree from Rutgers, like me), and this list didn’t have a geographer. And as geography is what I do —well, that didn’t feel quite right.
