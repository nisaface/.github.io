Yasiin Bey (Mos Def) agreed to be force-fed and filmed in a video put together by the amazing folks at [Reprieve](http://www.reprieve.org.uk/). While certainly a problematic aestheticization of the practice, it is still extremely important—if uncomfortable—viewing:

The hunger strike and subsequent force-feeding of over a hundred detainees at Guantanamo Bay has (finally) garnered increased media attention. It's an abhorrent practice that medical ethicists (long before the War on Terror) determined to be equivalent to a war crime. Based on some of the work in my dissertation, I’m working on a paper addressing the ways in which the version of ‘care’ on display through practices like this and others that occur in military detainment facilities—ones that begin from the standpoint that a prisoner cannot starve themselves to death (especially as an act of political resistance)—are key elements in the performance of humanitarian violence. Rather than being the [least of all possible evils](http://www.amazon.com/The-Least-All-Possible-Evils/dp/1844676471), it is a twisted articulation of the least of all possible goods: food as a polticized weapon of life.
