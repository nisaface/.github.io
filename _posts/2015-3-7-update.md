My forthcoming [article](http://www.envplan.com/abstract.cgi?id=a140104p) on care and violence in military detainment is posted in an online only version at *Environment & Planning A*. The paper came out of a session devoted to the question of 'humanitarian violence' at the Los Angeles AAGs, where all of the presenters sought to critically engage with or extend Eyal Weizman's arguments in [*The Least of All Evils*](http://www.versobooks.com/books/532-the-least-of-all-possible-evils).

[Lisa](https://geography.osu.edu/people/bhungalia.1), [Tish](http://geography.dartmouth.edu/people/patricia-lopez), and [Léonie](http://www.mmg.mpg.de/departments/socio-cultural-diversity/scientific-staff/dr-leonie-newhouse/) did the hard work of organizing the papers (and their authors...) and writing up an introduction to a special section of the journal to be out at some point this year. Thanks guys!

Léonie's paper is [online](http://www.envplan.com/abstract.cgi?id=a140106p) too, and I'm looking forward to reading it and all of the other papers in the print version.
