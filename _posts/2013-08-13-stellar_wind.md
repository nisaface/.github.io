<p>This <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/magazine/laura-poitras-snowden.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/magazine/laura-poitras-snowden.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">article</a> on Laura Poitras and Glenn Greenwald from today's <em>New York Times</em> is bonkers. You really get a window into how crazy it must be to live with a heightened 'risk profile':</p>

<p><blockquote>Though she has written to members of Congress and has submitted Freedom of Information Act requests, Poitras has never received any explanation for why she was put on a watch list. “It’s infuriating that I have to speculate why,” she said. “When did that universe begin, that people are put on a list and are never told and are stopped for six years? I have no idea why they did it. It’s the complete suspension of due process.” She added: “I’ve been told nothing, I’ve been asked nothing, and I’ve done nothing. It’s like Kafka. Nobody ever tells you what the accusation is.”</blockquote></p>
<p>These national security practices are autonomous <em>and</em> out of control: a dubious combination. The article also contains a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/video/2012/08/22/opinion/100000001733041/the-program.html" title="http://www.nytimes.com/video/2012/08/22/opinion/100000001733041/the-program.html">link</a> to a short 'OpDoc' that Poitras made for the <em>Times</em> in August of 2012.The video focuses on NSA whistleblower William Binney, and is definitely worth ten minutes of your time:<br><br>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting comment in the film, at least for me, was the clear articulation of the NSA's understanding of the word 'intercept'. On a panel at the DefCon Convention in Las Vegas, Alexander Abdo, the Staff Attorney for the ACLU National Security Project notes (at around the 4 minute mark) that:</p>
<img class="quote" src="http://www.crisisofenclosure.com/images/quote.png"></p>
<p><blockquote>Acquisition isn't the search, the querying later on is the search."</blockquote></p>
<p>It's a bit striking to think that the wholesale vacuuming up of any and all information is thought of as completely innocuous, implying that the politics is merely in the application of the search algorithms that define the limits of things like 'threat' or 'enemy'. Since the politics only emerge the moment that these 'refined' searches are sent through the database, everyone else has nothing to worry about. See?! That was easy!</p>
<p>Can it possibly be true that the the national security state actually sees data as being free of politics? No way. Do they care. Nope. Should we? I think so.
