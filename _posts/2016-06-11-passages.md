After a long week scoring Advanced Placement exams in Ohio, I had the pleasure of seeing Do Ho Suh's [beautiful show](http://www.contemporaryartscenter.org/exhibitions/2016/02/do-ho-suh) *Passage* at the Cincinnati Contemporary Art Center this week. Even though I was often drawn to simply consider the exhibit's myriad technical marvels, I think it's so powerful a body of work because there's so much humor and longing and hope that traces across all of the pieces. The everydayness of the objects and spaces, when recreated faithfully in a new material, truly becomes exceptional.
