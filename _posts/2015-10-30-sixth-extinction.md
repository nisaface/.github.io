In the second chapter of Elizabeth Kolbert's [*The Sixth Extinction*](http://www.amazon.com/The-Sixth-Extinction-Unnatural-History/dp/0805092994) there's a section where she details the historical emergence of the idea of extinction (an idea I never imagined as having a pre-history). In it, she describes a mistakenly identified fossil found in the Netherlands that had been given the name *Homo diluvii testis* (or ‘man who was witness to the flood’). Given what I've been reading lately---like William Gibson's *The Peripheral* and other anthropo-scenic lit---I couldn't help but think that this name---originally meant for an organism with a "large, half-moon-shaped skull"---could describe a global us, the mass of humans living through the anthropocene observing and producing a long, slow flood on a biblical scale, but largely ambivalent about it.

In this way, the name *homo diluvii testis* also recalls Giorgio Agamben's exploration of  *homo sacer,* a person both inside and outside of law---banned from the city and able to be killed with impunity, but not sacrificed.  I started to wonder if perhaps we have become *homines diluvii testis* (pardon my ignorance of Latin here...).

I'm not sure if this is a global nihilism, an engagement with the horror of philosophy, or something ontologically different in degree, so I suppose that after I finish *The Sixth Extinction* I should pick up [Eugene Thacker's](http://www.amazon.com/In-Dust-This-Planet-Philosophy/dp/184694676X) *In the Dust of This Planet: Horror of Philosophy vol. 1.*
