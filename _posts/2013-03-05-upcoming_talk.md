title: "Upcoming Talk"
---

I'm really excited that the Center for Middle Eastern Studies is bringing Laleh Khalili to give a talk at Rutgers next week. Her book, [_Time in the Shadows: Confinement in Counterinsurgencies_](http://www.amazon.com/Time-Shadows-Counterinsurgencies-Laleh-Khalili/dp/0804778337) came out as I was in the final push to complete my dissertation, and while I was able to read it (and even cite it!) in my own work, it is only with a bit of time away from that beast that I have really been able to grasp what an excellent book it is. The subject of her talk is proxy and invisible detainment, something that has been central not just to fighting counterinsurgencies, but has emerged as a more general practice that increasingly operates across the divide between war and not war. Should be a fascinating talk.
