I'm hoping to find the time Monday evening to attend the [Guant√°namo Diary](http://www.pen.org/event/2014/12/12/guant%C3%A1namo-diary-evening-reading-and-conversation) reading and conversation at the PEN America Center. The book itself was [recently reviewed](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/books/review/guantanamo-diary-by-mohamedou-ould-slahi.html?_r=0) by Mark Danner in the *New York Times*. He writes:

> "In this way the vast and brutal American interrogation mechanism, stretching around the globe in an archipelago of black sites housing hundreds of detainees at the mercy of untold numbers of interrogators, transformed itself into an intricate machine for generating self-reinforcing fiction. The process, which has never been described more intimately or more convincingly, resembles nothing so much as a postmodern globalized version of the Salem witch trials: zealous inquisitors, untroubled by doubt, applying a relentless violence to conjure up a fantasy world born of the collective terrors of their own imaginations."
