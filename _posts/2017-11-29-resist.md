I really enjoyed the interview with [Joe Masco](https://anthropology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty_member/joseph_p._masco) from the most recent *[Cultures of Energy](http://culturesofenergy.com/101-joe-masco/)* podcast. The pod is always good--funny and light but also rigorous and thought-provoking. I recommend. Anyway, towards the end of this episode, the conversation shifted to a discussion about the role that certain images played in producing the logics of national security in the Cold War, and the perils of repeating those practices as the security/insecurity narratives shift to address global climate change. The hosts [Dominic Boyer](https://anthropology.rice.edu/dominic-boyer) and [Cymene Howe](https://anthropology.rice.edu/cymene-howe) toyed with the idea of t-shirts imploring the population to resist both the nuclear and the climate sublime.

After a long day teaching with a beast of a head cold, I didn't want to grade. So, randomly, I made these. I don't think they're ominous enough, nor do they get at the intensity of these sublimes, but they still allowed me to feel productive while I watched a basketball game.
