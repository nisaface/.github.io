Students in my Global Development course read Sylvia Federici's ["Wages Against Housework"](https://caringlabor.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/federici-wages-against-housework.pdf) this week, and the discussion the text provoked was one of the most lively and critical that I've ever had in any of my classrooms. Students seemed willing to engage with a whole suite of issues--from the problem with naturalized gender roles to 40 years of transformations in economies of care (especially vis. migrant women doing carework) to some pretty substantive questions about capitalism and justice. I often feel like these questions remain stuck behind students' thick wall of suburban apathy. But this. This was a breathe of fresh air.

My friend [Emily](http://syr.academia.edu/EmilyMitchellEaton), who originally sent me the essay over the summer (after meeting Federici) also sent along this image, which is great.

Strike while the iron is hot, people.
