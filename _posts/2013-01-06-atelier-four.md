We've been camped out in our temporary home in *les banlieues* of Paris (and in our particular case, a banlieue rouge) for about a week. I've been sick the entire time we've been here. But the BNF has finally opened its doors to both N and the new year, and I am slowly but surely finding my health enough to manage life as a dad again. Today while the wee one (who has also been sick) was having *un petit sommeil* I started doing some investigating about the apartment we've been living in. When I saw the window details of the building I knew that the place we were staying in would classify as 'Capital M-Capital-A' Modern Architecture, but I had no idea just how important this group of buildings and their architects were to late French modernism until I did some digging.

![Blue Windows](/img/windows.jpg)

<cite>Here are the windows. They're painted wood frame, floor-to-ceiling height, and rather drafty in the winter. It's clear that the windows were designed by someone with an eye towards classical proportion and the kind of sensibility one typically assigns to mid-century modernists.</cite>

My digging was prompted not by our building, but by the one that sits on the other side of the neighboring library. It had the feeling of a modern Gaudi project. Clearly designed around a triangular grid, the building had juts and strange acute angles everywhere. The columns canted in, and while the section seemed traditional enough, there were even nods to the triangle in the elevation.

I of course love these buildings if only because, and this is also why I really love French cities in the general sense, someone gave the architect the chance to take a risk. There's a lot of really amazing architecture and design in France, but there is also an unusual amount of risk-taking that completely fails. And that, in particular, is what I love. Not the failure, but the willingness to take the plunge with something so monumental as a building, to not take space or space-making for granted and to try to see what space can do, what it can be. This is also importantly not simply a question of design aesthetics, but a question of the way design functions in the performance of life itself. These buildings don't look cool. What they *do* do is seek to stake a claim, to make a statement about how urban life and space *should* be. Architecture is politics. Perhaps this just makes me a delusional modernist at heart, but I still think it's wonderful.

Architects Jean Renaudie and Renée Gailhoustet designed the whole suite of projects here in Ivry. Renaudie, who was trained at l'École des Beaux-arts and later worked under Auguste Perret, had by the end of the 1960s grown tired of walking in Corb's brutalist shoes (from '58-'68 with Pierre Riboulet, Gérard Thurnauer, and Jean-Louis Véret as [Atelier de Montrouge](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atelier_de_Montrouge)) and set off in an entirely distinct direction. These buildings seem to blend public and private spaces, heavy and light, and certainly seek to emulate the complexity of urban life while introducing a hint of some kind of order. It's funny that they render the shadows in the elevation in red here, because in the winter, our building feels grey grey grey. Whatever the color, the buildings and renovations of the *centreville* in Ivry earned Renaudie (and Gailhoustet?) le grand prix national de l'architecture du Ministère de la Culture.

So while the town's buildings certainly bear the markings of Le Corbusier (the aforementioned window details, the *beton brut* concrete, the open plan) he would probably have considered these buildings to be formal abominations. But they are beautiful and sublime, even in the cold, grey winter of Paris. I found some images of the buildings from the springtime, and they just overflow with green, as if the concrete completely disappears into a terraced hillside. I'd love to tour the apartment units, to see what the quality of light is in the spaces actually designed for living.

Our particular apartment is not part of the triangle buildings, but is instead in *Le Liegat, Building H* (from 1982?), a building modeled on overlapping dodecahedrons (I've seen them called octagons, but the schematic site plan makes it clear that eight is not enough) that are terraced and planted in much the same way as the other buildings. We're in an atelier on the street level that was, I believe, initially part of a crafts studio workshop that made up the bottom section of the mixed-use building. The whole place is kind of amazing.

The biggest bummer about the whole downtown area is that the street level functions have been routed by the vagaries of neoliberalism, and the many vacant storefronts and ateliers make the buildings' complexity seem dangerous, rather than playful. Lots of little corridors and dark empty courtyards are probably not places you'd want to be if alone at night. Some of the spaces are - from drawing board to construction - just plain bad ideas. But the experience of walking through these crooked (but not curved) passages in building H is really unique. I wouldn't call it parallax, but it is certainly close.
