During her talk at workshop I attended at the University of Toronto, the inimitable Laleh Khalili read the entirity of a poem by Derek Wolcott titled *The Sea is History.* I'm not often moved by poetry, but this particular one really seemed to strike a chord with me. Here's the first stanza, the rest of it can be found [here](https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/sea-history).
>Where are your monuments, your battles, martyrs?
Where is your tribal memory? Sirs,
in that grey vault. The sea. The sea
has locked them up. The sea is History.
