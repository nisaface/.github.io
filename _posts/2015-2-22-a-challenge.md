I have a lot of writing deadlines coming up. But despite having an article and a book prospectus looming, I have found it really hard to find time to simply sit and write. Whether it's course preparation or car repair, something always seems to pop up that makes having large blocks of uninterrupted time (how I typically write) nearly impossible. As a result, I've not made much headway on important projects.

Perhaps I'm being silly, but I have decided to set a new writing goal for myself: to spend no more than ten minutes each day writing a post here about something--*anything*--in order to get my fast-twitch writing muscles into shape. When I was in grad school I started this site as a place to write that was more structured than diary writing but less demanding than academic writing. Even though I didn't write al that much, I think it worked. So I'll try again, and hope that writing here will lead to more writing there.
