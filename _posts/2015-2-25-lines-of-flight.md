[Spencer Ackerman's](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/18/american-police-brutality-chicago-guantanamo)  [recent](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/26/police-black-site-chicago-washington-politicians-human-rights) [dispatches](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/25/chicago-homan-square-former-justice-officials-call-for-investigation) in *The Guardian* introduce an important element into recent scholarship exploring the blending of the spaces and tactics of war with the spaces and tactics of policing. The uncovering of domestic black sites in Chicago (and their attendant interrogation methods) warrants a brief reflection, I would think, on work like Mark Neocleous' book [*War Power, Police Power,*](http://www.amazon.com/War-Power-Police-Mark-Neocleous/dp/0748692371/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1424969652&sr=1-4) Jeremy Kuzmarov's [*Modernizing Repression*](http://www.amazon.com/Modernizing-Repression-Training-Nation-Building-American/dp/1558499172/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1424969622&sr=1-1&keywords=modernizing+repression), and basically anything by [Alfred McCoy](http://www.amazon.com/Alfred-W.-McCoy/e/B001HCXSTA).

It's also interesting to think about how the narrative of Detective Zuley's abuses, their integration into the military detention facility at Guantánamo, and return to Chicago's Homen Square flips (or at least complicates) the 'colonial boomerang' diagram offered up by Foucault:

Foucault writes:

> "…while colonization, with its techniques and its political and juridical weapons, obviously transported European models to other continents, it also had a considerable boomerang effect on the mechanisms of power in the West, and on the apparatuses, institutions, and techniques of power. A whole series of colonial models was brought back to the West, and the result was that the West could practice something resembling colonization, or an internal colonialism, on itself."
<cite>—Michel Foucault, *Society Must be Defended*, 2003

In the story we are learning here, the first stage in the 'boomerang' *is* the internal colonialism Foucault foreshadows, the one practiced in Chicago by the police on communities of color. But here, it is then sent flying again towards those 'other' spaces he mentions, where they are again amplified and refined. Zuley first began working for the Chicago Police Department in 1977, so it would be interesting to learn to what degree his policing tactics were influenced by the International Police Academy and their work in Southeast Asia and Latin America during the Cold War. How long has the boomerang been flying?

If nothing else, these connections and lines of flight between war and policing offer the possibility of complicating the spatial and temporal clarity of Foucault's out-and-back metaphor, or expanding the arc of the boomerang from colony&#8594;homelnd to something like:

<cite>war&#8594;police&#8594;war&#8594;police...

or maybe

<cite>external&#8594;internal&#8594;external&#8594;internal...

Perhaps, in the end, the migration and transformation of these practices is more a reflection of what Didier Bigo [called](https://www.academia.edu/3102803/The_M%C3%B6bius_ribbon_of_internal_and_external_security_ies_) the "mobius ribbon of internal and external security".  

Ackerman was recently on *Democracy Now!* discussing these reports:
