During her talk at workshop I recently participated in at the University of Toronto, the inimitable Laleh Khalili read the entirety of a poem by Derek Walcott titled *The Sea is History*. I'm not often moved by poetry, but this particular poem really seemed to strike a chord with me. Here's the first stanza:

> Where are your monuments, your battles, martyrs?<br>
Where is your tribal memory? Sirs,<br>
in that grey vault. The sea. The sea<br>
has locked them up. The sea is History.<br>
<cite>“The Sea is History” from *Selected Poems by Derek Walcott*. 2007</cite>

The rest of it can be found [here](https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/sea-history).
