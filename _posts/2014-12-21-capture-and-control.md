I'm teaching this course for the first time in the spring. While I am still trying to finalize the readings, I thought I'd post what I have.

#### COURSE DESCRIPTION

Modern democratic states often rely on practices of detention and incarceration in order to demonstrate (and increasingly, to circumvent) the power of the rule of law. As a result, international and domestic detention spaces like refugee camps, jails and for-profit prisons, war prisons, black sites, migrant detention islands, border checkpoints, and protest camps are utilized in an ever-expanding number of spatial, legal, and political contexts. In this course we will explore these spaces, and engage in a detailed historical and theoretical investigation of the complex and often-contradictory processes that produce them.

Globalization, as an economic process and spatial practice, is often associated with movement, speed, and dynamism. However, with increasing regularity, spatial isolation is called on to preserve or secure these spaces of movement and exchange. Moving beyond simple walls and cages, detention spaces are increasingly intertwined with the cross-border flows of people, goods, and capital that have come to describe global modernity. This poses challenging legal, spatial, economic, and political issues at the heart of globalization, and these will frame class discussions and debates.

#### COURSE OUTLINE

The course is loosely divided into two sections. The first section of class--which will take us until Spring Break--is designed to introduce the central themes and questions surrounding the history and development of the prison apparatus *in the United States*. We will trace a narrative through readings that deal with uses and abuses of incarceration and its rapid expansion in America; with the issues of race, property, and economy; and with the role of the state. Part two—the second half of the semester—will cover a range of issues pertaining to the uses of detainment and sequestration in a global context. We will wrestle with the issues of mobility and migration; with political asylum and refugee camps; with torture and issues of bodily harm and control; and with the contradiction of detainment for punishment and detainment for security.
