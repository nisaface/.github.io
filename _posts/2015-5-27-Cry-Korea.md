This passage, from Reginald Thompson's 1951 book *Cry Korea,* detailing his time as a war correspondent in Korea (here during the Inchon Landing), finds him deeply troubled  by the reality of warfare at a distance. His language certainly foreshadows key aspects of many contemporary critiques of drone warfare and other forms of precision war:

> “No infant peering with dark round eyes from the wrappings at its mother’s back through all the centuries had known the terror these infant eyes now knew, the terror of death without discrimination, death without courage, distributed like rain to fall alike upon the innocent and the guilty, released from afar off. Impersonal, yet shockingly personal. No longer did men or women perish by the sword, neither did the slayers confront the slain, knowing in the giving of death and its acceptance something human. At least responsibility.<br><br>Now in the twentieth century as it moves towards sanity or mad despair the slayer needs merely to touch a button, and death is on the wing, blindly, blotting out the remote, the unknown people, holocausts of death, veritable mass-productions of death, spreading an abysmal desolation over whole communities and the fertile body of the earth.<br><br>
Yet of all those who pressed these buttons few might dare to put to death even one woman or child by the sword…”

<cite>Thompson, *Cry Korea*, page 41-42.
