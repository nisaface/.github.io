title: "The end of man is to know"
---

I'm working on putting together two talks for next week, and in reading something I wrote a long time ago, I came across this really great quote from Robert Penn Warren's _All the King's Men_:

> The end of man is knowledge, but there's one thing he can't know. He can't know whether knowledge will save him or kill him. He will be killed, all right, but he can't know whether he is killed because of the knowledge which he has got or because of the knowledge which he hasn't got and which if he had it would save him. Thereâ€™s the cold in your stomach, but you open the envelope, you have to open the envelope, for the end of man is to know.
