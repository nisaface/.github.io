I recently had a discussion with my department chair, and after I mentioned that I would love to teach an undergraduate course that centered on histories of technology (and STS more broadly), he expressed interest. Even though this is only in the early stages of planning (I wouldn't teach it for over a year), today I am nonetheless daydreaming about what the syllabus would cover, what readings we'd do, and mapping out interactive projects for the students.
