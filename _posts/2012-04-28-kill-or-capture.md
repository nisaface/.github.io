- Abstract for the Political Geography Pre-Converence, 2012

Recent scholarship has focused on the ways in which an array of new military technologies have redefined the nature of the battlefield, shortened the kill chain, and laid claim to the production of so-called precision warfare. More often than not, these studies concentrate on one side of the kill/capture dualism that fills the pages of military doctrine and strategic analyses: the use of deadly violence. In this paper, I explore the shifting spatiality of the other side of the slash, paying close attention to the ways in which the changing geographic imaginaries of the battlefield have altered the spatiality of apprehension. Capture is a productive spatial process, quite literally making something—the prisoner of war, the civilian internee, the unlawful combatant (and the attendant administrative processes for each)—that must be managed, moved, and cared for. Yet despite its significance as a spatial threshold, capture remains largely absent from studies of wartime violence. Countering this trend, and making the space of apprehension visible as an interface of control, I trace the connections between several battlefield tactics used in the conflict in Afghanistan, describing how the performance of capture has been designed and managed as a specific site of intervention.
