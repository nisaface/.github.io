<p><a href="http://geographicalimaginations.com/2013/02/15/soldier-exposures/">Derek Gregory</a> points to this <a href="http://www.publicbooks.org/artmedia/soldier-exposures-and-technical-publics">excellent visual essay</a> curated by Zoë H. Wool about the play between soldier's material vulnerabilities and exposures and the various technologies that work to organize the geographies of war. In her description of the project, Wool [who is a post-doc at <a href="http://www.ihhcpar.rutgers.edu/about_us/members.asp?v=2&i=733">Rutgers</a>] notes that:</p>
<img class="quote" src="http://www.crisisofenclosure.com/images/quote.png"></p>
<p><blockquote>These are not iconic images that ‘speak for themselves’ but less conventional ones that suggest both the technical expertise involved in producing and managing war’s violence and the vulnerability of soldiers at the heart of war. In considering these images as technical, we highlight the many forms of war’s material and technical expertise, expertise that is often disarticulated from the social, political, and ethical fields on which war equally relies.”</blockquote></p>

<p class="note">Wool's <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00141844.2012.658428">own work</a> demands that we rethink the lived experiences of soldiers (and soldier bodies) as they move through space after they've been transformed by violence in the combat zone. One can see both the parallels and extensions that this visual essay offers to her 'traditional' ethnographic work. The linked essay is one of the most interesting things I've read about the corporeality/carnality of war in a long time.</p>

<p>The narrative of disembodied vision and fields of technical expertise really does underpin the contemporary imaginary of automated, precision war at a distance. But as Caren Kaplan’s image [below] conveys, the very unmanned nature of unmanned aerial vehicles is a dubious misnomer. The automated vision of the drone's gorgon stare is simultaneously human vision and a set of embodied visual practices. She writes that "Drone sight comes from the body of the nation and serves as its eyes; it sites all of us, dividing people into possible targets—the viewed—and the viewers." I'm particularly interested in this human/non-human sight assemblage, but it is also worth noting that this form of vision defaults to a relatively straightforward graphic representation of space, bodies, and motion. Put dumbly: The soldier sees a lot of things that look like the things that they look like. </p>

<p>This got me thinking about my own work on digital biometrics, and the ways that vision and visual representation are changing. They're changing not only the capacities of the state 'to see' the battlespace in certain ways, but also perhaps shifting the ways we think about 'sight' into something that can be compiled across space and time by way of a series of ones and zeros. In what ways does this augment relations between bodies and technical apparatuses? Is the biometric database a visual field?</p>

<p>To the linked image collection, then, I could see adding the below picture of a soldier enrolling an Afghan civilian into a biometric database. These databases are proliferating across numerous spaces both within and beyond the battlefield - the work they do is often "disarticulated from the social, political, and ethical fields on which war relies." But the work they do is also described as a weapons system: the biological data of the population at war is understood as a weapon that can be turned on itself. An image like this also conveys a bodily practice in which the soldier body acts as (and at) a vulnerable interface, not unlike a border checkpoint or other inanimate threshold. There's an explicit politics here, too. How is this soldier's body being imagined? Regulated? <i>Exposed</i>? And of equal importance, how is the body of the Afghan civilian likewise being imagined, regulated and exposed?  </p>
