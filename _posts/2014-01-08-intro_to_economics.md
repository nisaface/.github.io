Spring 2014

This course serves as an introduction to the core principles, theories, and histories of economics, with specific attention to the issues that shape the spatial contours of the global economy. We will work to develop a basic understanding of contemporary public debates about economic policy and explore the relationships between spaces, labor, and markets. By the end of the semester, we will have engaged with concepts like globalization, austerity, and neoliberalism and studied the often-conflicting roles of economic actors like states, producers, and consumers.

This is not technically a microeconomics course, nor is it a macroeconomics course. Instead, this class seeks to foster critical economic thinking and prepare students to engage with broad economic debates in order to understand the role that markets and exchange play in structuring our world.
