This week, Ta-Nehisi Coates published a short but lovely [tribute](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2015/02/king-david/385596/) to David Carr. I had been familiar with Carr's writing, his curmudgeonliness, and to some degree his incredible biography, but I didn't know much about his advocacy and mentorship of young writers or the ways that he was so devoted to the craft of writing. In the piece, Coates notes extensively his status, before working for Carr, as a master of the "art of fucking up." It's hard for me to imagine Coates struggling as a writer or having difficulty getting published--for a long time I've found his writing to be as beautiful as his critiques are devastating and important. It's easy, seductive even, to think that writers and writing are born beautifully formed. But of course, they are not. This is something that I need to be reminded of often.

And sadly, the world is not formed in such an attractive way either--the resilient structures of power and privilege keep many whose voices should be heard from reaching us. In this world, Coates explains, Carr was the rare exception:  

>...David was a tireless advocate of writers of color, of writers who were women, and of young writers of all tribes. This is highly unusual. Journalism eats its young."

Beyond all of Carr's concerns for what Coates calls the "technology of storytelling," it seems that his care for writers and his awareness of his position within a landscape of power were as important as (if not more important than) his focus on writing. I should remember that, too.
