>"The plunderers of the world they have laid waste the land till there is no more left, and now they scour the sea. If a people are rich they are worth robbing, if poor they are worth enslaving; and not the East and not the West can content their greedy maw. They are the only men in all the world whose lust of conquest makes them find in wealth and in poverty equally tempting baits. To robbery, murder, and outrage they give the lying name of government, and **where they make a desert they call it peace.**"

<cite>Tacitus, *The Agricole and Germania,* passage XXX.
