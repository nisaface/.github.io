I'm lucky enough to know some really talented people, and even luckier to get the opportunity to work with some of them every once in a while. Here's an excerpt from a map I am making for my brother-in-law that will hopefully be available in print soon. While I am not a cartographer--I only know rudimentary QGIS--I'm learning, and I really enjoy the design process and using the part of my brain that I used regularly during my previous career as an architect.
