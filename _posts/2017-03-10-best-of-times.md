I was reading up on Operations Research in the early 1950s, a time when human decision-making and automated/scientific decision-making were both seen as suspect in different ways.

<cite>From "Our Greatest Secret Weapon" a piece about O.R. by Lieut. Col. David Parker (Aug. 5, 1951) in *This Week*. I originally came across the citation in *Rational Action: The Sciences of Policy in Britain and America 1940-1960* by William Thomas, summarized [here](https://www.informs.org/ORMS-Today/Public-Articles/June-Volume-42-Number-3/History-of-OR-Useful-history-of-operations-research)</cite>
