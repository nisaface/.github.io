> "You can know more and more about one thing but you can never know everything about one thing: it's hopeless. So that we live surrounded by more or less ghostly objects--that machine, there, for instance. It’s a complete ghost to me--I don’t understand a thing about it..." [^1]

I'm currently reading a [book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1595340416/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (Peter Turchi's *Maps of the Imagination*) for a reading group and it reminded me of an old map I made for an early issue of [*Exchanges*](http://exchanges.uiowa.edu/), a literary translation journal. The idea behind the map, and the theme of the journal issue, was "*Madness and Civilization.*" Made when I was still an architect, the map that initially emerges slowly fades by way of a Flash animation. Its details recede into blankness and what remains are the three ghostly forms drowning in madness as Hieronymus Bosch-esque bodies of water.

> "Perhaps our ultimate blank is the space between reader and writer--or, more accurately, the space between the story we create and the and send out to the world and the story each reader perceives." [^2]

There is something really compelling about the connections between writing, mapping, and blankness that Turchi so carefully details. He targets the fine line between clarity and confusion, and between the truths claimed by toponyms and the madness of the empty map. Unlike Conrad's famous "white spaces" on the map, the imagined blanks onto/into which explorers and colonial powers worked to erase the evidence of civilization however, in this example the relationship is flipped.
